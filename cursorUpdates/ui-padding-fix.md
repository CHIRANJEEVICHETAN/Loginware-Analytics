# UI Padding Consistency Fix

## Implementation Details

- Removed excessive right-side padding across pages by:
  - Reducing chart right margin from 30px to 10px in all chart components
  - Updating container padding in tailwind.config.ts from 0.75rem/1rem to 0.5rem/0.75rem
  - Adding `max-w-full` to the dashboard layout container to prevent overflow
  - Adding `w-full` class to all overview components to ensure proper width

## Affected Components/Hooks

### Layout Changes
- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`: Updated container padding and added max-width
- `tailwind.config.ts`: Reduced default container padding

### Component Changes
- `components/operator-performance-overview.tsx`: Reduced chart margins and added w-full
- `components/production-overview.tsx`: Added w-full class
- `components/utilization-overview.tsx`: Reduced chart margins and added w-full
- `components/downtime-overview.tsx`: Reduced chart margins and added w-full
- `components/machine-status-overview.tsx`: Added w-full class
- `components/maintenance-overview.tsx`: Added w-full class

## Styling/Navigation Changes
- Reduced right margin in charts from 30px to 10px for consistent spacing
- Ensured all grid containers have `w-full` class for proper width
- Reduced container padding in tailwind config for more screen real estate

## Performance Optimizations
- No specific performance optimizations were made as this was a UI consistency fix
